**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Paper has been accepted at AAAI 2019. Final version can be found here:
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09065.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09065.pdf).

For the moment, the repository only has scripts to evaluate binary word
embeddings. The entire code to generate binary vectors will be available for the
AAAI 2019 conference (January 27 -- February 1 2019).
