                 Near-lossless Binarization of Word Embeddings
                 =============================================

ABOUT

  This repository contains source code to binarize any real-value word
  embeddings into binary vectors. It also contains some scripts to evaluate the
  performances of the binary vectors on semantic similarity tasks and top-k
  queries. Related paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09065.pdf.

  To compile the source files of this repository, you need to have on your
  system:
    - OpenBLAS [1]
    - a C compiler (gcc, clang ...)
    - make

  Then run the command `make` to build the different binary executables.
